# Weather Widget

There are a group of computer science teachers who are interested in teaching about data and coding as it relates to weather. 

They were planning on using [this website](https://sites.google.com/sandi.net/csweather), however there is an issue with one of the widgets.

You can see the issue here:  
![weather widget only showing celsius](https://github.com/drguthals/buildwithdrg/blob/main/weather-widget/weather-widget-issue.png?raw=true)

The issue is that there is no way to update the temperature into Farenheight. 

This will be tracked on the [Weather Widget](https://github.com/drguthals/buildwithdrg/projects/1) project.
